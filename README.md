# Typy

A fun typing game to play with strangers (or friends)! You can read all about it on it's portfolio post [here](http://kamranpayne.com/projects/2015/06/22/typy.html). It was built using Harp.

### TL;DR
It's a simple free Firebase app that uses AngularJS (before it was too cool for school and started using TypeScript) and Firebases own AngularFire library.

The app uses Firebase for storing all user profile information, authentication handling, and realtime communication between clients and Angular to make everything show up on the screen fast enough.

It's pretty fun to play a few times for a little while.
